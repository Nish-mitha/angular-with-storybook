# [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/docs/angular/get-started/why-storybook)

Storybook is a tool that helps you develop and showcase UI components in isolation. 
It provides a sandbox environment for each component, allowing you to view and interact with them independently of the rest of your application. 

## âœ¨Features

- Documentation for the Component library.
- Test runner to automatically test your entire Storybook and catch broken stories.
- Unit tests for functionality
- End-to-end tests for simulating real user scenarios
- Visual tests capture a screenshot of every story and then compare it against baselines to detect appearance and integration issues
- Accessibility testing ensures that digital content and interfaces are usable and inclusive for all users, including those with disabilities.
- Interaction tests verify component functionality by simulating user behavior, firing events, and ensuring that the state is updated as expected
- Snapshot tests detect changes in the rendered markup to surface rendering errors or warnings
- Coverage tests to measure how much of your code is covered by your tests
- Storybook integrates with design tools to speed up your development workflow.
